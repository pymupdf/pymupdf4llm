## **Forward-looking Statements** 

This report includes “forward-looking statements” that give our current expectations or forecasts 

of future events. They include estimates of natural gas and oil reserves, expected production, assumptions regarding future natural gas and oil prices, planned drilling activity and capital expenditures, and future asset sales, as well as statements concerning anticipated cash flow and liquidity, business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations. Although we believe the expectations and forecasts reflected in these and other forward-looking statements are reasonable, we can give no assurance they will prove to have been correct. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. 

Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expected results are described under “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K included in this report. We caution you not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, and we undertake no obligation to update this information. We urge you to carefully review and consider the disclosures made in this report and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the risks and factors that may affect our business. 

The SEC requires natural gas and oil companies, in filings made with the SEC, to disclose proved reserves and permits the optional disclosure of probable and possible reserves. While Chesapeake has elected not to report probable and possible reserves in its filings with the SEC, we have provided estimates in this report of what we consider to be our “total resource base.” This term includes our estimated proved reserves as well as “risked and unrisked unproved resources,” which represent Chesapeake’s internal estimates of volumes of natural gas and oil that are not classified as proved reserves but are potentially recoverable through exploratory drilling or additional drilling or recovery techniques. Our estimates of unproved resources are not intended to correspond to probable and possible reserves, as defined by SEC regulations, and are by their nature more speculative than estimates of proved reserves and accordingly are subject to substantially greater risk of being actually realized by the company.
