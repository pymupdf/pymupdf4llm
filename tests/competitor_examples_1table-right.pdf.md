MONALEESA-3 Primary Results



locoregionally recurrent disease not amenable to curative treatment) breast
cancer. Additional eligibility criteria were as follows: (1) newly diagnosed
(de novo), advanced breast cancer, (2) relapse . 12 months from completion
of (neo)adjuvant endocrine therapy with no treatment for advanced or
metastatic disease (criteria 1 and 2 referred to as treatment na¨ıve in the
advanced setting hereafter), (3) relapse on or within 12 months from
completion of (neo)adjuvant endocrine therapy with no treatment for advanced or metastatic disease (early relapse), (4) relapse . 12 months from
completion of (neo)adjuvant therapy with subsequent progression after one
line of endocrine therapy for advanced or metastatic disease, and (5) advanced or metastatic breast cancer at diagnosis that progressed after one line
of endocrine therapy for advanced disease with no prior (neo)adjuvant
treatment for early disease (criteria 3 to 5 referred to as received up to one line
of endocrine therapy for advanced disease hereafter). Criteria 1 and 2 includes
patients receiving treatment in the first-line setting; criteria 3 to 5 includes
patients receiving treatment in the second-line setting or with an early relapse.
Patients had at least one measurable lesion per Response Evaluation
Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST; version 1.1) [11] or one predominantly
lytic bone lesion, with adequate organ and bone marrow function and an
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1.
Patients were ineligible if they had received prior treatment with
chemotherapy for advanced disease, fulvestrant, or a CDK4/6 inhibitor; if
they had inflammatory breast cancer, symptomatic visceral disease, or any
disease burden that made the patient ineligible for endocrine therapy per
investigator judgment; or if they had clinically significant cardiac
arrhythmias and/or uncontrolled heart disease, including a QT interval
corrected for heart rate according to Fridericia’s formula (QTcF) . 450 ms.


Procedures
Tumor response was assessed locally per RECIST (version 1.1) at
screening, every 8 weeks after random assignment for 18 months, and
every 12 weeks thereafter until disease progression, death, withdrawal of
consent, or loss to follow-up; for patients who discontinued for any other
reason, assessments continued per protocol. Imaging data from approximately 40% of randomly selected patients were reviewed centrally by
a blinded independent review committee (BIRC).
AEs were monitored and graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.03). [12] Safety follow-up was
conducted for at least 30 days after patients’ last study treatment dose. ECG
assessments were performed at screening, on day 15 of cycle 1, on days 1
and 15 of cycle 2, on day 1 of all subsequent cycles up to cycle 6, at end of
treatment, and as clinically indicated. In patients with a QTcF $ 481 ms at
any time before cycle 7, additional ECGs were performed predose on day 1
of subsequent cycles and postdose every third cycle.


Primary and Secondary End Points
The primary end point was locally assessed PFS. To support the primary
end point, a BIRC performed a central assessment of PFS in a randomly selected
subgroup of patients. Secondary end points included overall survival (OS),
overall response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate, and safety and tolerability.


Statistical Analysis
The primary analysis compared PFS between the treatment arms using
a stratified log-rank test. The treatment effect was estimated using a Cox
proportional hazards model overall and in relevant subgroups. The central PFS
assessment used in support of the primaryefficacyend point was analyzed using
a Cox proportional hazards model. The primary PFS analysis was to be
performed after observing approximately 364 local PFS events to detect a hazard
ratio of 0.67 with 95% power and a one-sided 2.5% level of significance.
OS was compared between the treatment groups using a stratified logrank test at a one-sided 2.5% level if the primary PFS end point was
significant. A three-look design was used, with up to two OS interim
analyses (the first was performed at the time of the PFS analysis) and
a final OS analysis planned. The Lan-DeMets a-spending function with
